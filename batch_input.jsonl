I came into grand forks for a wedding and one of the guests wouldn't stop raving about parrots cay wings. Thinking that there was no way they could be THAT good, I reluctantly stopped in to try these wings. First impressions were great, loved the divey feel of the place and brought me back to my college days. Tap beer list, nothing really worth writing home about, but they have the standards you would expect at a divey college bar.  Then the wings. The first thing I noticed is they didnt use franks out of the bottle, second thing was that the wings were phenomenal.  The wings were perfectly crispy on the outside, yet still juicy on the inside. The buffalo sauce was flavorful, and spicy, but not to the point of ruining your taste buds for the rest of the meal. The wings came with a cup of ranch, which wasn't needed because the sauce was just that good.\n\nSo major props to cays.

Twice it has happened that I have ordered the shark wings and received their regular buffalo wings instead. Now I work at a restaurant and I know how busy it gets and how stressful it gets as well, but what happened next really puts a damper on my experience. I waited until the server came around and she asked if anything was wrong and I stated that I ordered the shark wings and not the buffalo wings. Her response was \"you didn't order the shark wings but I will have them make new ones.\"\n\nI was dumbfounded. As stated above, I have ordered the same thing every single time without changing and the server is accusing me of being wrong. NEVER should a server say that to a customer. We would get reprimanded big time where I work if we did this. I get it, yes it is noisy and it is hard to hear but come on, take some responsibility.\n\nThe second time it happened I simply stated the same that I ordered the shark but got the regular buffalo and said it was no big deal that if I could just simply get a side of the shark, I would be fine. Again I was accused of ordering something I didn't order and said she would have to charge me for the side of sauce or I could just have them remake it.\n\nWell right there is one of the dumbest things I have heard. I had them remake it and waste the wings the buffalo sauce and make new wings instead of just getting a side of shark sauce.\n\nThe service is lacking big time and if it weren't for the great food, I would not go back and the place would be gone by now in all honesty I'm sure.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

And I've looked all over the world. The Parrot's Cay is a cajun dive bar in Grand Forks ND, let that sink in for a minute. It's the type of place that would be on Diners and Dives if they ever came to North Dakota. Their cajun buffalo sauce is the best I've ever had. Their shark sauce wings won first place in Buffalo NY.\nThe wings all have an adjustable heat level, based on a number scale that ranges from 3-30. Most people would probably want to start at a 7 on that scale. The heat challenges get insane. They also serve Lavash, Crawdads, Pasta and Po'boys. But the wings are the star of the show.\n\nThe Cay has the best food you can get in the entire state of North Dakota, and that isn't even a compliment. Grand Forks is a college town, so this place can get packed often. It's a bar, so you have to be 21 to enter. Tons of beers on tap. Enjoy.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Everything was just a little off, not enough to be bad, but not great. Bread with the cheese plate and charcuterie was cold and seemed almost stale. Lemon cake dessert was pretty flavorless and lacked any lightness or brightness I would expect from lemons, although the accompanying lemon sorbet was amazing. Our server was good, but after very clearly telling her that my partner had a nut allergy, the server didn't think to mention that there were nuts on the dessert. The burger was a rather soggy mess, but the flavor was fine. The fries were not crisp and fresh, but they were OK. Again, nothing was exactly bad but thoroughly underwhelming. They have some great cocktails and a good atmosphere, but I'm just not excited to go back there to eat.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Mezzaluna is top notch, for any city. And, not to take anything away from the food, because it was all spectacular; but it is the Service that puts a dining experience at Fargo's Mezzaluna up there with some of the best restaurants I've enjoyed across the USA. The Service is simply outstanding: Our Server, Hannah, was intelligent, personable, perfectly attentive, and expert in all of her duties, from beginning to end. I strongly suggest requesting a table in Hannah's section when you book your reservation. 5-Star food across the board too: Be sure to try the bruschetta appetizer, which is done like no other. Mezzaluna has my highest recommendation. The Service at this restaurant is almost reason enough to make a trip to Fargo.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Upon arrival, the restaurant was very noisy. We were confused as to why a \"high end\" restaurant sounded like a bar. Food was very bland and poor quality. Service was great can't complain about that. I ordered the crab stuffed Walley with lentils and it was very bland. My guy ordered prime rib. The quality of meat was very tough to cut into but tasted ok. Upon leaving we noticed a guest with sweat pants and flip flop came in to dine. It's just surprsing to us seeing some of the patrons dressed down when it's supposed to be a \"high end\" restaurant. Not that it bothered us but Fargo, ND really need to step up its definition  of a \"high end\" establishment. After leaving Mezzaluna we went to a Taco truck. That says a lot.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, I was not impressed with the food. I'm from the East coast  (Jersey and lived in Atlanta) and travelled to many different places with top notch foods and I heard about this place from a coworker of mine. So far since I've been living in ND for 5 years, I have been to Sky's in Grand Forks, The Hodo in Fargo, and Usher' s house in Moorhead, MN and they're on the same scale with Mezzaluna's, being classy dinning and my experience was GREAT at these other restaurants. So, I figured Mezzaluna's can be added to my list but unfortunately not. I made a reservation for a post-Valentine's day outing. I had Filet mignon and it was ok and my date had Leg of lamb and hers was very chard and a bit under cooked to the point where she couldn't finish it. Our waitress saw our reaction  (which is commendable on her part) and offered a free desert, which is fair. We selected the Carmel Apple pie with vanilla ice cream. Thinking it would be nice and warm, with the ice cream melting on top...to my biggest disappointment, it wasn't warm at all! It was cold and bitter! I was shocked! Who serves cold apple pie with vanilla ice cream?? Even McDonald's Apple pie is served warm and places like chain restaurants such as Red Lobster serve their pies nice and warm. I was pretty upset, especially money wise! But nonetheless, it was my first time going and my last unfortunately. If you're into classy dining and looking for great food to come out of it, I suggest the Hodo and Usher's House as the go to spots in the Fargo-Moorhead area. Thanks!\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

But I am highly disapointed in my experience. I was recommended to this establishment by people in my home state and also at my hotel when I arrived in Minot for business. Upon arrival for lunch last week, my client and I were greeted promptly. The rest of our experience was like night and day. The first server, short dark curly haired lady whom i didnt get her name (wish i had) that came to our table seemed very irritated by my clients questions about the menu, beer ect. We shrugged it off and proceded to order our food and some standard domestic beer.... (Would have liked to hear about other options...but apparently our questions were too much at the time for her).\nWe had ordered an app that was delivered by another server who was a complete 180 from the original lady that we had. She was able to answer a few questions about some beer that was on tap and even went as far as to bring us a sample with a smile! Sweet. Food came and was delicious thankfully because our the curly haired server dropped our food off with a puff and didnt even ask if we wanted any condiments. So why a 1 star? Not the end of the world so far right? Well half way thru our meal the table across from us received something wrong on their meal. They did not seem too upset and the other server was prompt to fixing her mistake... Not awful until said curly haired server went off on the poor girl in front of other patrons and even mumbled a derogatory comment under her breath as other the worker walked away. Everyone in the area was left feeling uncomfortable. It was very unprofessional and I am assuming the dark haired gal must be in some sort of management position, which to me says alot about this establishment. I am embarassed I brought my client here and strongly suggest to others to be hesitant before doing so.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We've tried to stop there several times recently and they were either closed or had private parties.\n\nToday we stopped by and they were luckily open, only to be incredibly disappointed by the food and service.  First, we were sat right next to the kitchen at a table (never given the option of the open booths) and it was LOUD.  Second, our waitress had the attitude that she would've liked to be anywhere but at work (we saw her twice, once to take our order, and once to drop off our bill).  Third, the food was just plain bad!!!  My wife loves their meatball sandwich, it was dry NO SAUCE, just meatballs!!!  I got one of their brick oven pizzas, it was doughy and undercooked.  We couldn't even flag someone down, while it was busy the staff wasn't hustling so much that they overlooked us, there was a group of them hanging out at the booth by the restrooms.  Couldnt get anyones attention, they just ignored everything.  Finally, they are offering a reduced menu because of \"COVID\" so good luck if your favorite meal didn't make their cut.\n\nThis was it for our family, we won't be returning  to the Rooster.  There's plenty of other places opening up in Minot that have better food and service.\"\n\nJSON Response Format Example:\n{\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions\": 1,\n    \"Arrival & First Impressions_Sentiment\": 2,\n    \"Waiting Time\": 0,\n    \"Waiting Time_Sentiment\": 1,\n    ...\n}\n"}], "temperature": 0}}
